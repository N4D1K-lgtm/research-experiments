## [01: Recursion Phase Transitions](https://github.com/N4D1K-lgtm/research-experiments/tree/main/projects/01-recursion-phase-transitions)

A function that can call itself can represent unbounded computation. But abstraction, the ability to treat a pattern as a thing, seems to need something more: applying an operation to its own output and recognizing structure in the result. The question is whether there's a critical depth where this kicks in.

Combinatory logic is a good place to test this because it's minimal (three primitives, three reduction rules) and self-application is native to it. Any term can be applied to any other term.

## Other directions

From the same [research document](https://github.com/N4D1K-lgtm/research-experiments/blob/main/projects/01-recursion-phase-transitions/RESEARCH.md):

- Whether self-narration (generating descriptions of experience and feeding them back as training data) improves learning efficiency
- Knowledge representation using continuous spectra instead of categories
- Communication systems based on relative positioning in continuous space vs discrete symbols
