# About

Experiments on recursion and formal systems. The broad question is when and why recursive processes produce structure that's useful for building further structure on top of.

The first project uses combinatory logic as a test case because it's minimal (three primitives, one operation, three reduction rules) and Turing complete. If abstraction emerges from recursion in general, it should show up here.

Other directions I want to look at eventually involve self-narration as a learning mechanism, continuous vs categorical knowledge representation and emergent communication protocols. These are outlined in the [research document](https://github.com/N4D1K-lgtm/research-experiments/blob/main/projects/01-recursion-phase-transitions/RESEARCH.md).

Nothing here is published. It's just experiments.
