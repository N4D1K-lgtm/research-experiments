# Kidan Nelson

B.S. Computer Science, University of New Hampshire CEPS. At the [UNH Interoperability Laboratory](https://www.iol.unh.edu/) since 2023.

Interested in the intersection of communication, cognition and computation. How structure arises in formal systems. How naming and abstraction change what a system can express. What that has to do with language and thought.
